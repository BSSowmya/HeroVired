        <p>
        Celebrated every year from October 2 to 8, #DaanUtsav or Joy of Giving is India’s biggest festival of giving during which people come together and perform acts of kindness by giving their time, material or money in interesting ways to any cause(s) of their choice.

        From auto rickshaw drivers to CEOs, school children to celebrities, homemakers to opinion leaders and media personnel, millions of people from all walks of life come together during this week to give their time, money, resources, or skills back to society. They do this by creating or participating in events of their choice.

        <h1 className="main_class"><u>The Benefits of Why giving?</u></h1>
        <p>
        An act of kindness lasts long. It gives you a feeling of satisfaction and fulfilment, apart from giving underprivileged children a chance to improve their circumstances and lessen the hardships that they face in their daily lives. Donating to NGOs that work for the cause of people with limited means is the best way to do your bit for the society as a whole. Non-Governmental Organisation are doing all it takes to plug the gaps in “India Growth Story”.

         <li>You get a feeling of satisfaction and fulfilment when you donate money to NGOs.</li>   
         <li>The more you give, the richer you feel!</li>   
         <li>Your small donation makes a lot of difference.</li>   
         <li>A sense of giving back to the society you are a part of.</li>   
        </ul>

        <p>
        There are uncountable reasons that make donating to NGOs a very sensible act. Many people feel the need to work for the society or do something for others in need but factors like stress, busy lives and dearth of time keep them from doing so. Amidst all this, it’s totally apt to offer some financial support to an NGO doing great work on the ground. This way you have a chance to be a change-maker without actually going on the ground.

        <p>
        To help someone in need by giving doesn’t require a specific week or time! All we need is a heart full of fellow feeling and then every day can be a Daan Utsav! However, in this modern and fast-paced world, where many of us are forced to lead hurried, mechanical and demanding lives, our empathy for others seems to be diminishing. Our increasingly self-centred lifestyles prevent us from looking past our individual and narrow shells and really see people who need our help.
        </p>
        <p>
        This festival of philanthropy reminds us all that being compassionate and caring for others and helping those who are in need is something that restores the humanity in all of us. The festival celebrating generosity reminds us that there are millions of people, who are vulnerable and deprived, it is our duty as concerned human beings to help each other and restore faith in humanity. Daan Utsav is celebrated to give all people hope, happiness, and faith that the world is not a bad place after all. That there are people who will always be there to help each other and support one anothe

        Be part of India’s largest philanthropic event — #DaanUtsav ( formerly the Joy of Giving Week).
       </p>
       <p>
       DaanUtsav is India’s very own festival of giving. It aims to spread love, joy and happiness among those who are lesser fortunate than us, and for each one of us to experience the joy in giving. It is like our own Eid or Diwali, with a key feature that it celebrates “giving”. People celebrate this festival in various ways. Some people donate money, some their time, some materials, and some just pure love.

       <p>
       In the Joy of Giving Week, we encourage you to make your health a priority in ways that suit you. Along the way, don’t forget to think about how you can help others reach their goals, too — it’s likely to work out in your favor, anyway.
